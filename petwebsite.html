        <h2>German Shephard</h2>

        <p>German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, when viewed in outline, presents a picture of smooth,
             graceful curves rather than angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they can turn it up a notch or two and 
             reach great speeds.</p>
        <p>The first impression of a good German Shepherd Dog is that of a strong, agile, well muscled animal, alert and full of life.
             It is well balanced, with harmonious development of the forequarter and hindquarter. The dog is longer than tall, deep-bodied,
              and presents an outline of smooth curves rather than angles. It looks substantial and not spindly, giving the impression, 
              both at rest and in motion, of muscular fitness and nimbleness without any look of clumsiness or soft living.
